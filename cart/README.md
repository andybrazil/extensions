2. Create a **cart** folder in your templates folder
3. Upload cart/index.tpl and cart/checkout.tpl to the *cart* folder
4. Create a new section. Set the extension to cart.js and the template
   to cart/index.tpl
5. Change the email address at the top of cart.js to whatever email you
   want to send the orders to (a comma separated list of emails works as
well);
